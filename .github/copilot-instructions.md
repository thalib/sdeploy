# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## IMPORTANT: Must Follow

- **Source of Truth:** Always refer to `SPEC.md` for all architecture, configuration, and operational details.
- Do not introduce patterns or workflows not present in `SPEC.md`.
- Never reference or use content from `docs/` or `example/` directories for production operations.

## Follow the Spec (`SPEC.md`) Exactly

When performing tasks, strictly adhere to the guidelines and structures defined in `SPEC.md`.

For all operations, consult these sections in `SPEC.md`:

## Best Practices

- Follow industry best practices for Go.
- Research the internet and use MCP servers (context7) for latest documentation.
- Keep all code, configuration, and documentation lean, simple, and clean.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and duplication.
- **DO NOT** include commands unless very necessary for context.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory:**
	- Every feature, bugfix, or refactor must be accompanied by one or more unit tests before implementation.
	- All major logic modules require corresponding `*_test.go` files.
	- No code is considered complete or production-ready without passing tests, as enforced in `SPEC.md`.

# PRD Template

- The `prd` directory contains product requirement documents.
- PRD file naming convention: `prd/001-feature-name.md`
- For all product requirement documents, use the following template:

```markdown
## Overview
- What is this and why
- Overview
- Overview

## Requirements
- What must it do?
- Requirements
- Requirements

## Acceptance
- How do we know it’s done?
- Acceptance
- Acceptance
```
