# 📦 SDeploy: Simple Webhook Deployment Daemon

This document outlines the features and requirements for SDeploy, a lightweight, Go-based daemon service designed to automate application deployment via incoming webhooks.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Policy

All Go source code in SDeploy MUST be developed using test-driven development (TDD):

- Every new feature, bugfix, or refactor must be accompanied by one or more unit tests before implementation.
- All major logic modules (webhook, deploy, config, email, logging) require corresponding `*_test.go` files.
- Tests must cover:
  - Webhook validation and routing
  - Deployment locking and execution
  - Config loading and error handling
  - Email notification logic
  - Logging output and error capture
- CI/CD or local workflows must run `go test ./cmd/sdeploy/...` and all tests must pass before merging or release.
- No code is considered complete or production-ready without passing tests.

**Enforcement:**
- PRs and code reviews must reject changes that lack appropriate tests.
- All contributors must follow TDD for every code change.

## 🚀 Overview and Goal

SDeploy provides a dedicated service that listens for external webhook notifications (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, CI/CD) and triggers a local deployment script.

### 🔑 Core Principle: Single Execution

Only one deployment process runs at a time for any given project. New webhook requests arriving during an active deployment are safely skipped until the current one finishes.

## 🏃 Installation and Usage

The compiled binary is named `sdeploy`.

### Execution Modes

| Mode         | Command           | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Console      | `./sdeploy`       | Foreground, blocking. Output to stdout/stderr. Used for testing/setup.      |
| Daemon       | `./sdeploy -d`    | Background service. Output to console/logger. For use with system services. |

Custom config file path: `./sdeploy -c /home/user/my_project/sdeploy.conf -d`

## Project Folder Structure

```bash
sdeploy/
└── cmd/
    └── sdeploy/
        ├── main.go
        ├── webhook.go
        ├── deploy.go

```

### Running SDeploy as a Service (Production)

#### 1. Using systemd (Linux)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/sdeploy.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=SDeploy Webhook Daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=sdeploy_user  # Dedicated, non-root user
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin/
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/sdeploy -d
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Commands:
```sh
sudo useradd -r sdeploy_user
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable sdeploy
sudo systemctl start sdeploy
sudo systemctl status sdeploy
```

#### 2. Using nohup

```sh
nohup /path/to/sdeploy -d > sdeploy.log 2>&1 &
```

## ⚙️ Configuration (`sdeploy.conf`)

SDeploy uses YAML format for configuration. It searches for config file in order:
1. Path from `-c` flag
2. `/etc/sdeploy.conf`
3. `./sdeploy.conf`

### Sample Configuration Files

- **[samples/sdeploy.conf](samples/sdeploy.conf)** — Minimal quick-start example
- **[samples/sdeploy-full.conf](samples/sdeploy-full.conf)** — Full reference with all fields and comments

### Sample Example

```yaml
listen_port: 8080

email_config:
  smtp_host: smtp.sendgrid.net
  smtp_port: 587
  smtp_user: apikey
  smtp_pass: SG.xxxxxxxxxxxx
  email_sender: sdeploy@yourdomain.com

projects:
  - name: User-Facing Frontend
    webhook_path: /hooks/frontend
    webhook_secret: secret_token_for_frontend_repo
    git_repo: git@github.com:myorg/frontend-app.git
    local_path: /var/repo/frontend-repo
    execute_path: /var/www/site
    git_branch: main
    execute_command: sh /var/www/site/deploy.sh
    git_update: true
    email_recipients:
      - frontend-team@domain.com
      - on-call@domain.com

  - name: Backend REST API
    webhook_path: /hooks/api-service
    webhook_secret: api_prod_key_777
    git_repo: https://gitlab.com/api/backend-service.git
    local_path: /opt/repo/api-repo
    execute_path: /opt/services/api
    git_branch: staging
    execute_command: /usr/bin/supervisorctl restart api-service
    git_update: false
    email_recipients:
      - api-team@domain.com
```

### Global Email Configuration

| Key          | Description                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| smtp_host    | SMTP server address                         |
| smtp_port    | SMTP server port (e.g., 587 for TLS)        |
| smtp_user    | Username for SMTP authentication            |
| smtp_pass    | Password or API key for SMTP                |
| email_sender | Sender email address                        |

**Email Notification Behavior:**
- If `email_config` is absent or any required field (`smtp_host`, `smtp_port`, `smtp_user`, `smtp_pass`, `email_sender`) is missing/invalid, email notifications are **globally disabled**.
- When disabled, a log message is recorded: `"Email notification disabled: email_config is missing or invalid."`
- Per-project: If `email_recipients` is absent or empty for a project, email notifications are **disabled for that project only**.

### Project Configuration

| Key               | Description                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| name              | Human-readable project identifier                         |
| webhook_path      | Unique URI path (e.g., /hooks/api)                       |
| webhook_secret    | Secret key for webhook authentication                     |
| git_repo          | (Optional) Git repository URL (SSH/HTTPS). If absent or empty, no git clone/pull is performed. |
| local_path        | Local directory for git operations or local project path  |
| execute_path      | Directory for deployment script execution                 |
| git_branch        | (Optional) Branch required to trigger deployment. Default: `main` |
| execute_command   | Shell command to execute                                  |
| git_update        | (Optional) If true, run `git pull` before deployment. Default: `false` |
| timeout_seconds   | (Optional) Hard timeout for command execution             |
| email_recipients  | (Optional) Array of notification email addresses. If absent or empty, email notifications are disabled for this project. |

**Git Behavior:**
- `git_branch`: If not set, defaults to `main`.
- `git_update`: If not set, defaults to `false` (no automatic `git pull`).
- `git_repo`: If absent or empty, **no git clone or pull is performed**. The `local_path` is treated as a local directory (either an existing local repo or a non-git directory) and only the build/execute commands are run.
- **Clone Logic:** If `git_repo` is set and the repo is not already cloned at `local_path`, it will be cloned. If already cloned, skip cloning.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Webhook Listener:** Configurable port (default: 8080) for HTTP POST requests.
- **Flexible Routing:** Routes requests by URI path to the correct project.
- **Authentication (HMAC & Secret Fallback):** Prioritize HMAC signature (`X-Hub-Signature`). If missing, fallback to secret in URL query.
- **Branch Verification:** Ensures webhook payload branch matches configured branch.
- **Asynchronous Deployment:** Valid requests trigger deployment in background, respond `202 Accepted`.
- **Pre-flight Directory Checks:** Automatically verifies and creates deployment directories with correct ownership and permissions before each deployment.
- **Git Update Control:** If `git_update` is true, run `git pull` before deployment (default: `false`).
- **Git Clone Control:** If `git_repo` is set and repo not already cloned, clone it. If already cloned, skip cloning.
- **Local Directory Support:** If `git_repo` is absent/empty, treat `local_path` as a local directory and skip all git operations.
- **Robust Execution:** Runs shell command in specified directory.
- **Environment Variable Injection:** Injects project details (e.g., `SDEPLOY_PROJECT_NAME`, `SDEPLOY_TRIGGER_SOURCE`) into deployment environment.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Logs start/end time, output, status, to stdout/stderr or log file.
- **Startup Logging:** On daemon start, print all global settings and project configurations to the log file.
- **Per-Build Logging:** For each build/deployment, print the project configuration in the log.
- **Email Notification:** On completion, sends summary email if configured (disabled if `email_config` is missing/invalid or `email_recipients` is empty).
- **Hot Reload:** Configuration file changes are automatically detected and applied without restarting the daemon.

## 🔍 Pre-flight Directory Checks

SDeploy performs automated pre-flight checks before each deployment to ensure directories are properly set up.

### Pre-flight Check Behavior

| Aspect                | Behavior                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directory Existence   | Checks if `local_path` and `execute_path` directories exist              |
| Auto-Creation         | Missing directories are automatically created with 0755 permissions      |
| Ownership Management  | When running as root, directories are owned by `run_as_user:run_as_group` |
| Path Defaults         | If `execute_path` is not set, it defaults to `local_path`                |
| Logging               | All directory creation and ownership changes are logged                  |

### Pre-flight Check Flow

1. **Validate local_path:** Check if exists, create if missing
2. **Validate execute_path:** Check if exists (defaults to local_path if not set), create if missing
3. **Set Ownership:** If running as root, chown directories to configured user/group
4. **Log Actions:** All actions are logged for transparency

### Error Handling

| Error Type            | Handling                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Path is a file        | Deployment fails with clear error message                                |
| Permission denied     | Deployment fails with clear error message                                |
| User/Group not found  | Warning logged, directory owned by root (when running as root)           |

## 🔄 Hot Reload

SDeploy supports hot reloading of the configuration file. When the config file is modified, SDeploy automatically detects the change and applies the new configuration.

### Hot Reload Behavior

| Aspect                | Behavior                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Detection             | File system watcher monitors the config file for changes                 |
| Validation            | New configuration is validated before applying; invalid configs are rejected |
| Thread Safety         | Configuration reload is thread-safe using mutex protection               |
| Build Deferral        | If a deployment is in progress, config reload is deferred until completion |
| Logging               | All reload events (success, failure, deferral) are logged                |

### What Can Be Hot-Reloaded

- **Projects:** Add, remove, or modify project configurations
- **Email Configuration:** Update SMTP settings and sender
- **Log File Path:** Change log file location (takes effect for new log entries)

### What Cannot Be Hot-Reloaded

- **Listen Port:** Changing `listen_port` requires a daemon restart
- **Active Deployments:** Ongoing deployments continue with the previous configuration

### Hot Reload Error Handling

| Error Type            | Handling                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File Read Error       | Log error, keep current configuration                                    |
| YAML Parse Error      | Log error with details, keep current configuration                       |
| Validation Error      | Log error with details, keep current configuration                       |
| File Watcher Error    | Log error, attempt to re-establish watcher                               |

### Hot Reload Logging

On successful reload:
```
[INFO] Configuration reloaded successfully
```

On reload error:
```
[ERROR] Failed to reload configuration: <error details>
```

On deferred reload (build in progress):
```
[INFO] Configuration change detected, reload already pending
[INFO] Processing deferred configuration reload
[INFO] Configuration reloaded successfully
```

## 🛡️ Operational Principles

| Principle           | Detail                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technology          | MUST be implemented in Go for performance/resource efficiency           |
| Security            | Each project uses its own webhook_secret for authentication             |
| Robustness          | Command errors are caught, logged, and do not crash the daemon          |
| Concurrency Control | Single-instance execution enforced per project using locks              |

## 📐 Execution Flow

1. **Daemon Startup:** Log all global settings and project configurations to the log file.
2. **Request Entry:** Webhook POST received.
3. **Validation (Security):** Check HMAC signature. If valid, trigger is WEBHOOK. If absent, check secret query parameter for INTERNAL trigger.
4. **Validation (Logic):** Verify git branch (for WEBHOOK). Use `git_branch` from config, or default to `main` if not set.
5. **Lock Check:** If deployment lock held, log "Skipped" and return 202. If not, acquire lock and proceed.
6. **Asynchronous Trigger:** Start deployment in background, return 202.
7. **Log Project Config:** Print the project configuration in the log for this build.
8. **Pre-flight Checks:**
   - Verify `local_path` exists, create if missing with correct ownership.
   - Verify `execute_path` exists (defaults to `local_path` if not set), create if missing.
   - If running as root, set directory ownership to `run_as_user:run_as_group`.
9. **Pre-Execution (Git Operations):**
   - If `git_repo` is absent or empty: Skip all git operations. Treat `local_path` as a local directory (existing repo or non-git directory).
   - If `git_repo` is set and repo not cloned at `local_path`: Clone the repo.
   - If `git_repo` is set and repo already cloned: Skip cloning.
   - If `git_update` is `true` (default: `false`): Run `git pull`.
10. **Execution:** Run `execute_command` in `execute_path` (with timeout, env vars).
11. **Cleanup & Notify:** Log result, send email notification (if `email_config` valid and `email_recipients` not empty), release lock.

## 🌐 Integration with Reverse Proxies

Recommended to run SDeploy behind a reverse proxy for TLS/SSL and rate limiting.

### Nginx Example

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.crt;
    # ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.key;

    location /hooks/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
        if ($request_method !~ ^(POST)$) {
            return 405;
        }
    }
}
```

### Caddy Example

```caddyfile
yourdomain.com {
    route /hooks/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 {
            flush_interval -1
        }
        @notPost {
            method not POST
        }
        respond @notPost 405
    }
}
```

## 🌐 Integration with Cron (Scheduled Deployments)

Scheduled deployments are triggered by external job schedulers (e.g., cron) sending an internal trigger request using the secret query parameter.

### Cron Job Example

```cron
0 3 * * * curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/hooks/frontend?secret=secret_token_for_frontend_repo" -d "{}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" >/dev/null 2>&1
```

SDeploy recognizes the missing HMAC, validates the secret, classifies as INTERNAL, and proceeds with deployment.
